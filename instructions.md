INSTRUCTIONS

The goal of this exercise is to simulate the creation of a report, by
merging two datasets together, and drawing some basic insights. Given
the stated assumptions, please provide your answers to the following 4
questions, as well as your code. Use of python, particularly with
Pandas, is encouraged.

**Source1.csv:**

-   Each “campaign” contains three elements, separated by the
    delimiter “\_”. The first element represents an initiative, the
    second represents an audience, and third represents an asset.

    -   “A\_B\_C” means the initiative is A, the audience is B, and the
        asset is C

-   Each “actions” value contains a list of dictionaries, where each
    element has an action and a type. For example {"x": 63, "action":
    "like"} means that there were 63 likes of type x.

**Source2.csv**

-   Each “campaign” contains the same three elements (initiative,
    audience, asset), separated by the same delimiter “\_”, but in this
    case the order of the elements is random.

**Assumptions:**

-   A “campaign” is a unique combination of Initiative, Asset and
    Audience

-   CPM = spend/impressions\*1000

-   CPV = spend/views ONLY for campaigns with an object\_type of video.
    Ignore spend and views for all other object\_types in
    calculating CPV.

-   All campaigns are represented for each day in source1.csv

-   There may be missing or duplicate campaigns in source2.csv

-   For all questions, ignore actions that aren’t of type X or Y.

**Questions:**

1.  How many unique campaigns ran in February?

2.  What is the total number of conversions on plants?

3.  What audience, asset combination had the least expensive
    conversions?

4.  What was the total cost per video view?
